I've moved my webspace from my own webspace to here, a GitHub pages... page? I've been using GitHub pages for work and I like working with Jekyll, so I figured now is as good a time as any to do some winter website cleaning. Over the next few weeks I'll be putting up descriptions of past projects as blog posts as I am able.
