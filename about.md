Hi, I'm Jeremy. I'm a librarian who doesn't always do traditional library things. Lately I've been working on finding ways to support research in the humanities, especially by creating new research infrastructure based on historical texts. I've also worked in usability, user/patron research, and bibliometrics. I like using technology to find new ways of looking at information, and also working to make sure that those technologies are available to as many people as possible.

When I'm not working, I like bicycling, home improvement (wherever home happens to be), and reading (surprise!).

If you're interested in digital scholarship, I'm always interested in hearing about new projects and sharing my experiences. Feel free to go through my [contact](/contact) page, or just [shoot me an email](mailto:jaguillette@gmail.com).
